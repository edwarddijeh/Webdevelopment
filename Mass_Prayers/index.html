            <h3>Prayer for the Seven Gifts of the holy Spirit</h3>
            <section>
                <p class="p1">O Lord Jesus Christ, Who, before ascending into heaven, didst promise to send 
                    the Holy Ghost to finish Thy work in the souls of Thy Apostles and Disciples, deign to 
                    grant the same Holy Spirit to me, that He may perfect in my soul the work of 
                    Thy grace and Thy love.</p>
                <p class="p2">Grant me the Spirit of Wisdom that I may despise the perishable things of 
                    this world and aspire only after the things that are eternal,</p>
                <p class="p3">the Spirit of Understanding to enlighten my mind with the light of Thy 
                    divine truth,</p>
                <p class="p4">the Spirit of Counsel that I may ever choose the surest way of pleasing God 
                    and gaining Heaven,</p>
                <p class="p5">the Spirit of Fortitude that I may bear my cross with Thee, and that I may 
                    overcome with courage all the obstacles that oppose my salvation,</p>
                <p class="p6">the Spirit of Knowledge that I may know God and know myself and grow 
                    perfect in the science of the Saints</p>
                <p class="p7">the Spirit of Piety that I may find the service of God sweet and 
                    amiable,</p>
                <p class="p8">the Spirit of Fear that I may be filled with a loving reverence towards 
                    God, and may dread in any way to displease Him.</p>
                <p class="p9">Mark me, dear Lord, with the sign of Thy true disciples and animate me in 
                    all things with Thy Spirit. Amen.</p>
